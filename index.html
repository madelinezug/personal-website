							<h1>Hi, I'm Maddie!</h1>
							<p class="major">I recently left Apple to pursue a long-time dream of living on a sailboat. I'll be sailing from San Francisco to Mexico later this year! </p>

							<p class="major">At Apple, I managed the Safety Engineering team within Trust & Safety. I focused on preventing technology-enabled abuse, stalking, and harassment on Apple platforms, and empowering survivors to gain control over their devices and data. I'm most proud of my work building <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/personal-safety/how-safety-check-works-ips2aad835e1/web">Safety Check</a>. Before joining Trust & Safety I was an engineer on the Accessibility team, working to make Apple products accessible to disabled users. </p>
								
							<p class="major"> In college I was interviewed in the <a href="https://finchcompany.com/projects/losing-lena-trailer/">Losing Lena documentary</a>, which discusses the exclusion of women from tech through the story of a woman whose Playboy centerfold became the basis of the modern JPEG. I got involved in this story as a high school senior when I wrote a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-playboy-centerfold-does-not-belong-in-tj-classrooms/2015/04/24/76e87fa4-e47a-11e4-81ea-0649268f729e_story.html">Washington Post OpEd</a> about how we need to stop using the image in classrooms. </p>
